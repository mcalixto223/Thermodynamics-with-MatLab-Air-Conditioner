# Thermodynamics-with-MatLab-Air-Conditioner
An air conditioner operates in 40°C weather to keep a room at 20°C by withdrawing 12,000 kJ/h of heat. 
Compare the answers you obtained by using the appendix table with those you obtained by using EES.
(a)	Assuming that the evaporator and condenser have perfect heat conduction, that the cycle is an ideal 
dry compression cycle, and that the working medium is Refridgerant-12 , determine the rate of heat rejected
to the atmosphere, the power required, the COP, and the COR.
(b)	If the air conditioner is redesigned so that it now uses R-123 , determine the rate of heat rejected, 
the power required, the COP, and the COR.
